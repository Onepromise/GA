var c1 = '"' + userName + ', slowdown! We need to take a break. We have been running for the last hour, and we need to take a break and figure out whats going on." You realize he is right, your legs have been cramping up for the past 15 minutes, but you have been so terrified that your adrenaline has numbed the pain. You start to slow down until you completely stop. Everyone starts to catch you and you can see some are limping and some are completely out of breathe. But everyone is still in shock. Everyone including yourself is trying to grasp what just happened. You were sleeping and you heard this bone chilling screech, you opened your room door to see Jessi, on the floor with blood dripping down her neck, her body is going into convulsions and twitching. And on top of her this guy, is eating her, just ripping off the flesh from her bone. Everyone else ran out their room to see whats going on. Your friend Tyler runs and grabs the guy and slams him against the fire place. The guy falls and slams his head on the edge of the fire place and just stays there lifeless. The next thing doesnt make sense. Jessi gets up and attacks Tyler Bitting him right on his leg. And then the guy who attacked Jessi gets up anf Bites tyler in the neck, we all screamed and ran out. Thats all I remember until now. Daniel walks up to you and says "We need a plan, instead of just running aimlessley down the road. I remember seeing some houses on our way up here. It would be faster to cut through the forest. We could probably get there in an hour if we walk. We can see if they could help us and explain what is going on." A few other people come up to us and one suggests we should follow the road to the highway we could easily get help there. They all look at you and wait for you to make a decision. What do you choose?'
var c3 = "You decided to go through the forest and try and avoid heavy populated areas. You head through the forest and make your way to the where you remember passing by some houses. As you travel through the forest you hear a loud explosion,and you see a huge smoke cloud through the clearing. It is in the same direction as the houses and you can start to see the houses as you almost exit the forest. You see 3 houses and 1 is on fire, probably the explosion you heard. Which house do you go to house 1 is closest to the fire, house 2 is the furest away from the house on fire but closest to the main road."
var c4 ="You decided to go to the high way. As you make your way to the highway, you noticed all the abandoned cars. Some are flipped upside down and there is blood and bodies everywhere. You do not see a single person. the smell of death is in the air and the stench is really strong. You hear a really low booming sound in the distance of the forest then you hear this low grumbling sound from around the cars, then you start hearing grumbles and  these weird noises coming from behind cars. As you carefully walk around trying to find where the sounds are coming from you notice that the bodies on the floor are starting to move. They get up and start walking to your group. You quickly look around and notice you are surrounded there are hundreds of them around you. You notice an RV off to the side of the road. What do you do? Do you run back the way you came and make a break for the forest or do you try and run to the RV?"
var c5 ="You make your way to the house closest to the fire. The smoke smell is extremely strong. It is really hard to breathe but you press on and make your way to the house. You kick down the door hoping to escape the smoke. As you enter the house, you get ambushed by 7 of those zombie like people. You manage to fight them off, but you lost a few people and some people are scratched up a bit. You started with 26 at the beginning of the trip now you are down to 14. You rest up a bit but you hear voices outside, you quickly head to the window to see who the voices are. You notice 4 people walking around scouting the house you are in. It seems they haven't noticed you there. What do you do? Do you attack them before they see you coming? Or do you flag them down and see if they are friendly, maybe they can help you? "
var c6="You picked the house furthest from the fire. You make your way towards the house, the door is open and you just walk in. The house seems empty. You rest up a bit and you hear some voices out side. You look out the window and you notice 4 people walking around the house scouting the house out. They haven't noticed your group yet. What do you do. You know they are going to come in and probably scavange the place. Do you attack them before they see you? Or do you call out to them and let them know you are friendly?"
var c7 ="You decide to run back and head through the forest. You make a break for it and tell everyone to follow you. You hear some of the people screaming behind you. You look back and you see some of the slower people getting caught and being eaten alive. Sadly there is nothing you can do to help them. As you make it into the forest you begin to slow down and see who is with you. You started with 26 people now you are down to 12. As you exit the forest you see You see 3 houses and 1 is on fire, probably the explosion you heard. Which house do you go to house 1 is closest to the fire, house 2 is the furest away from the house on fire but closest to the main road."
var c8=" You yell out to everyone to head to the RV.  You hear people screaming as these zombie like people are attacking and eating some people. Everyone starts freaking out and starts running to the RV. The door was open you run inside and people start pouring in. You realize not many of you made it in. You look out the window and you see your friends being eaten alive. There screams slowly died down and it was completely dead after. You started with 26 people when you went on this vacation now as you look around you have a total of 8. You rest up a bit and as you look out the window you notice a sign that says Walmart 3 miles away. There could be food there, everyone is getting hungry including yourself. What should you guys do? The zombie like people are slowly walking away, heading to the forest. Now is your chance. Do you head to Walmart or do you follow the highway the rest of the way and see what you can find?"
